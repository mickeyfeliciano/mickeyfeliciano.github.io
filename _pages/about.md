Native New Yorker, Mets fan, career change. Need to make this super long so I can see if it scrolls properly. 


Let's see hear. The quick brown fox jumped over the moon. What is Jimi doing? Need some more to write.
About me.


Will they play baseball this season? Why does the NL want a DH. I do not want that. I miss the team and Gary, Keith and Ron. I hope I find their names on the art that Ek got me. I wonder what will happen on the Challenge tonight. Will the MLB still have the same awards if they come back. Why haven't I gotten my grade for Data Mining yet? I would like to know what I got. I also have to remember to write Ashley Johnson. 

Ok hopefully this is enough.

I need to hydrate.
